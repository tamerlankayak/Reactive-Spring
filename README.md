# Reactive Programming Example API

This is a simple example API built using Spring Boot and WebFlux, demonstrating the concept of reactive programming. The API provides endpoints for fetching data asynchronously using the reactive programming model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the API, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle (depending on your preference)

## Getting Started

To get started with the API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd reactive-programming-example-api
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven or Gradle:

   For Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   For Gradle:
   ```bash
   gradle clean build
   ```

4. Run the API:

   For Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   For Gradle:
   ```bash
   gradle bootRun
   ```

5. Once the API is running, you can access the endpoints using the base URL `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

### Fetch Data

- **Endpoint:** `/data`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Fetches the data from a reactive data source.
- **Example Request:**
  ```http
  GET /data HTTP/1.1
  Host: localhost:8080
  ```
- **Example Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example Data"
  }
  ```
